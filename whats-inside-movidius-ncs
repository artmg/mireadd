## So what's inside my Movidius NCS 

As well as showing you pictures of what's inside the shiny blue stick in your hand, 
let's have a quick history lesson on the people that put it there.

Intel's Neural Compute Stick (NCS) is based on the Myriad 2 Visual Processing Unit (VPU). 
The company Movidius was started by a couple of guys from Dublin in 2005, 
Dr Sean Mitchell and David Moloney.

In 2013 they took Remi El-Ouazzane as their CEO, 
a bright young chap who'd made his name at renowned global chipmaker Texas Instruments, 
with numerous successes behind some of the processors 
that helped drive the growth in smart phones in previous years. 

Movidius contributed VPUs to the Google Tango project, with the 'Peanut' phone in 2014. 
And in January 2016 they announced a partnership with Google to power a VR headset 
to replace the Google Cardboard.

Their previous successes had allowed them to raise up to $90m dollars in funding, 
up until they announced their Fathon in April 2016. 
A few months later in autumn 2016 Intel decided they wanted in on the action and bought the company. 

It is clear that the Intel product designers were given two main objectives in their brief. 
The marketeers wanted them to turn it from a cheap looking pen drive 
into something sexy looking that geeks would associate with visual computing power. 
And the engineers must have mentioned that the chip gets a little bit hot when processing, 
so find a way to dissipate that safely by turning the body into a heat sink.

So there you have the product that enthusiasts across the world now have in their hand.
