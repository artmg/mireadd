## Introduction

This project is to recognise images coming from the webcam on a PC, 
using Lubuntu running in a Virtual Machine guest (VM). 
This example refers to Virtual Box options.

## Pass through your webcam

* Start your VM
* In Virtual Box Guest Menu (toolbar) / Devices / Webcams / _\<choose your webcam\>_
* Inside the actual VM's Start Menu / Sounds and Video / guvcview

This will test whether you have successfully passed your webcam into the VM

If guvcviev failed:
* Open terminal
```
sudo apt install -y cheese
```
* Then run
```
cheese
```

## Clone scripts to use

We found https://github.com/gudovskiy/yoloNCS a little complicated, 
so we wanted yo use https://github.com/jincongho/NCS_TinyYolo for the script to 
take the webcam feed and pass it to YOLO. However that was only compatible with 
NCSDK1, so we forked it to make it compatible with NCSDK2, 
in https://github.com/artmg/NCSDK2_TinyYolo

```
mkdir -p ~/CamRecog
cd ~/CamRecog
git clone https://github.com/artmg/NCSDK2_TinyYolo.git
cd ~/CamRecog/NCSDK2_TinyYolo
make
```

This should put up the images seen by the webcam with the detection boxes and classification of them

If you want to re-run just the detection part at the end

```
make run_py

# or

python3 stream.py
```

If you get failures during the make, 
here is a sample output from a successful make command, 
for you to compare with

```

## Next steps

* Re-assign classes
  * this solution is fixed with 20 image classes it looks for
  * work out how to modify those and focus on recognising something different
* Try a more accurate netowrk
  * According to http://cv-tricks.com/object-detection/faster-r-cnn-yolo-ssd/ the alternative networks SSD and Faster-RCNN might be ways to improve accuracy
  * however they are progressively more computationally heavy and might be slow or require specialist hardware like a GPU


## Improvements

* add this to the main NCAppZoo repo
  - fork https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo
  - go into your equivalent of https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo/tree/ncsdk2/caffe/TinyYolo
  - add in the stream code and submit a pull request
   - maybe add our code into V2 and jincongho into V1
