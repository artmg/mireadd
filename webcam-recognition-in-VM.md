## Introduction

This project is to recognise images coming from the webcam on a PC, 
using Lubuntu running in a Virtual Machine guest (VM). 
This example refers to Virtual Box options.

## Pass through your webcam

* Start your VM
* In Virtual Box Guest Menu (toolbar) / Devices / Webcams / _\<choose your webcam\>_
* Inside the actual VM's Start Menu / Sounds and Video / guvcview

This will test whether you have successfully passed your webcam into the VM
