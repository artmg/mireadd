This is how to set up a Raspberry Pi to execute via the Movidius NCS.

Note that you will not use the Full SDK, only the API. 
This means that you cannot **develop Graphs** on the Pi, 
only execute ones you have already developed.

You can see an introduction at [https://ncsforum.movidius.com/discussion/670/caffe-build-error-during-ncsdk-installation]

But the simplest build steps are at [https://movidius.github.io/blog/ncs-apps-on-rpi/]

## More on Pi

As an alternative to NCS + Pi why not consider 
Google AIY `VisionBonnet` addon for the Pi Zero 
for your project builds. 
It should slim things down and reduce power consumption.
Hopefully coming soon!
